Unreal Engine 4 Config Parser

UE4 configuration parsing and patching.

How it works:
    - parser library:
        - takes .ini file as input
        - analyzes file structure and contents
        - allows you to modify values for each unique key
        - supports visual output for clear overview of the configuration contents
        - once modifications are done, it creates a patch file and install in game files
            [Creating patch]:
                - creating directory structure from "/data/path.txt" contents
                - dropping altered configuration files inside the created directory structure
                - using unrealpak to create .pak file
                - dropping .pak file inside game's pak directory (default is in "data/pakPath.txt" but it varies on game so it can be altered)


Using:

1. You should have extracted config files ready, drop them in the "data/configs" folder.
    Note: I'm working on config-only extractor for .pak files and will be added to next releases

2. Run "main.py", it will open a terminal where you can navigate to the config file

3. From the configuration menu, you can alter the values in different formats, they are boolean, float, int, keybind values usually.

4. After altering the config, go to the interface menu and confirm changes

5. Once changes are confirmed, it will ask you if you want to install the changes

6. Further confirmation will patch game files and game will run with modified configuration
